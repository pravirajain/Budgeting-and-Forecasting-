# Budgeting-and-Forecasting-
In this project, I have developed a comprehensive business model to forecast and budget the financial performance of a company I created Henrys Hat. Utilizing my advanced Excel skills, I created a sophisticated financial model that incorporated
sensitivity and scenario analysis. By implementing 
variousscenarios, I assessed the impact of different 
market conditions on the company's revenue growth. 
To enhance visibility and facilitate data-driven 
decision-making, I designed and implemented a 
dynamic dashboard that visually presented the 
projected revenue growth trends. This project 
effectively showcased my proficiency in budgeting,
forecasting, and Excel, demonstrating my ability to 
leverage data analysis to drive informed financial 
decisions![image](https://github.com/pravirajain/Budgeting-and-Forecasting-/assets/142695978/fdf56117-76ba-4892-b8d2-023f1d324f20)
